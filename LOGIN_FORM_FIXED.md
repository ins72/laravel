# ✅ LOGIN FORM ISSUE FIXED

## 🎯 **Problem Resolved: Login Form Now Works Correctly**

The login form issue has been successfully fixed. The problem was that the form was submitting via GET request instead of POST, causing credentials to appear in the URL.

---

## 🔧 **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem:**
- Login form was submitting via GET request
- Credentials were appearing in URL: `http://localhost:8003/login?email=admin%40example.com&password=password`
- Form was not using Livewire properly for submission

### **Root Cause:**
- The login component was trying to redirect to `route('console-index')` which doesn't exist
- This caused Livewire to fail and fall back to regular HTML form submission
- Regular HTML forms default to GET method when no method is specified

### **Solution Applied:**
- Fixed the redirect route in the login component
- Changed from non-existent `console-index` route to proper routes:
  - Admin users: `route('admin.dashboard')`
  - Regular users: `route('user.profile.index')`
- Applied the same fix to the register component
